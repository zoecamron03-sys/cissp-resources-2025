Just cleared the CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) exam and wanted to share my experience for anyone preparing for it!

The exam is deep and broad â€” it tests not just memorization but how well you understand and apply security principles across all eight domains. You really need to think like a security leader, not just an analyst or engineer.

I used DumpsSpot practice tests throughout my prep, and they were extremely helpful. Around 70â€“80% of the real examâ€™s question style and difficulty level felt similar to what I practiced there.

Their detailed explanations helped me grasp tricky areas like risk management, cryptography, identity & access control, and security architecture. The rationales after each question gave me a clearer understanding of how to approach situational questions.

If youâ€™re planning to take CISSP soon, Iâ€™d recommend:

Focusing on understanding the concepts, not just memorizing terms.

Practicing lots of scenario-based questions.

Consistently scoring above 80% on mocks before scheduling your exam.

Itâ€™s a tough one, but definitely worth the effort â€” passing CISSP feels like a true milestone in your cybersecurity journey.
